    <p>
      Hi! My name is <strong>Rotaru Marius-Cosmin</strong> and I am a full-stack developer with a background in Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ETTI, Bucharest).<br />
      I am passionate about building modern, scalable web applications using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>.<br />
      I enjoy creating end-to-end solutions, from frontend UIs to backend APIs, and thrive on learning new tools while working independently or in teams. I am currently open to new opportunities as a frontend developer &ndash; letâ€™s build something awesome together!
