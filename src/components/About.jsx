    <p>
      Hi! My name is <strong>Rotaru Marius-Cosmin</strong> and I am a frontend developer with a background in Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ETTI, Bucharest).<br />
      I am passionate about building modern web applications using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Git</strong>.<br />
      I am always eager to learn new tools and best practices, and I enjoy working both independently and as part of a team. I am currently open to new opportunities as a frontend developer &ndash; letâ€™s build something awesome together!
